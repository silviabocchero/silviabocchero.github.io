      <h1>EN-ROUTE APP</h1>
      <h2>Service Desgin / App Design</h2>
     <p>En-Route is an app geared towards visiting students who are living in Milan. The goal of the app is to connect visiting students to locals and get a more “authentic” experience of Milanese culture based on their interests. The app allows the student to save the route through GPS tracking, take photos, and share the experience through social media. Routes continuously gets logged so users can decide to follow previous routes and participate in tours individually or with a local guide depending on their preferred travel style.</p>

        <h4>CONCEPT</h4>
        <p>Milan is not typical Italian city, it has international influences that has affected it’s fashion, architecture, food, history, arts, culture, and development. There is a gap for non local and foreign students experiencing the “real” Milan with generic tourist traps such as Duomo. The question arises, how do foreign students living in Milan experience local authentic Milanese culture? Is there a way to connect with Milan locals and find cultural authenticity within the city?</p>
